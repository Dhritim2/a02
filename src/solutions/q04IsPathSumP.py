"""## Question 4 **[PY]**{: .htag } ##

Given a weighted vertex graph $G(V,E)$, a start node
$s$ and a target sum $\\sigma$.

**Write an algorithm, or equivalently a python program
(WAP)** to inspect if there is a path from $s$ such
that adding up all the vertex weights along the path,
equals the target sum.

Note: $\\forall v \\in V\\; \\exists v.w$ that
represents vertex weights.
