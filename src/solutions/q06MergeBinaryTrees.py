"""## Question 6 **[PY]**{: .htag } ##

Given two binary trees, $A,B$, WAP to compute a merge
operation defined as follows:

Imagine that one is put on to cover the other; some
nodes overlap, while others don’t.  The merge rule
states that for each position in the binary tree, if
two nodes overlap, the value of the merged node is
their sum; otherwise, it’s the value of not null
node. _E.g._
