"""## Question 12 **[PY]**{: .htag } ##

**Island Perimeter**

Given a binary rectangular grid $M\\in\\{0,1\\}^{H\\times
W}$ with $H$ rows and $W$ columns, where each pixel
$m_{ij}$ represents either $0$ for water or $1$ for
land.  Assume that

1. Thereâ€™s exactly one island (contiguously connected
   land cells);
2. Pixels are connected either vertically or
   horizontally but not diagonally; and
3. There are no lakes.

WAP to determine the perimeter of the island!
